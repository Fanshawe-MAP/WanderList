## App Concept

**So, what is WanderList?**

Wander List is an app to manage the bucket list of places that one wishes to visit or has already visited.

**I see, and why does something like this exist?**

We all have a “wish-list”. Most of it in the form of a vague dream that pours forth during spare downtime. Imagine scrolling on Instagram, seeing a photo of a sunset across the ocean, and thinking: “Man, it would be nice to visit the beaches of Miami!”, just to be forgotten the next moment distracted by the antics of a cute cat.

The hustle bustle of day-to-day life verily rolls over such moments; we tend to forget why we work so hard, what we wish for, all our “some days” remaining forever in the realm of dreams.

Well - no more. Because WanderList brings those snatches of half-forgotten wishes back to the fore.

**Okay, and how does it work?**
